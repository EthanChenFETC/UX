                <p>In  2004, Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau (TANFB), Ministry of Transportation  and Communications is a statuary body tasked with overseeing the management of  the national freeway network. To implement  equity and consistency in toll fees, and improve administrative efficiency, TANFB  has adopted public-private-partnership (PPP) approach to designate private sector  to establish and operate ETC system through granting build-operate-transfer  (BOT) concession right of 20 years, thus the creativity and efficiency of  private sector can be introduced to expedite the development of ETC policy. FETC  is one of over 200 affiliated companies of Far Eastern Group (FEG), which is a  major conglomerate in Taiwan with business ranging in 10 various industries.  FETC is awarded by the TANFB to build and operate the ETC system and service  for nationwide freeways in Taiwan from 2004 to 2025.<br>

                <p>In 2006, FETC successfully launched flat-rate  pay-per-use ETC among 23 toll plazas with IR DSRC technology, and the  utilization rate had remained at approximately 40% for years, which was not sufficient  to implement the policy – achieving a distance-based and multi-lane free flow (MLFF)  nationwide ETC system. <br>

                Therefore, RFID was introduced to Taiwanese road users later on  in 2012 and with a rapid growth of public enrolment. The ETC usage rate accelerated  from 43% to 94% from May 2012 to Jan 2014 and the system was compatible with  both IR DSRC and RFID coexisting operation. This 1.5-years migration process  with well-planned rollout strategy and incentive programs allow sufficient ETC  penetration and society readiness for TANFB and FETC introducing MLFF with 319  gantries to road users on December 30th 2013. All the efforts to seamless migration not only from IR DSRC on-board-unit (OBU) to RFID tag,  but also from barrier-based tolling to MLFF have paid off. Currently more than 7 million users in Taiwan benefit from the ETC with more than  6 billion accumulated transactions.<br>

<p>FETC&rsquo;s exemplary performance is recognized by the most international  awards topping other ETC systems worldwide. What matters is not only how it  functions, but more importantly why it functions well, which is about the  principles of the system, the ease of use, the low cost to users, the high rate  of penetration,&nbsp;the system integration, public acceptability, fairness in  pricing, and near  perfect accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
It has to be mentioned Taiwan ICT Industry plays  key role, which makes Taiwanese ETC System different. It was built in a vision  of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) from the very beginning, allowing  road infrastructure and tolling system to achieve the ultimate goal - a  sustainable business from Smart Highway to Smart Nation.<br>

<p>Being the national tolling operator with the proven enterprise architecture framework, FETC has learned from  previous experiences to be proficient in  estimation of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return on Investment  (ROI) for managing financial risks when a country needs to implement  new system and migrate from previous one. <br>
The development of business-process-design (BPD)  and end-to-end architecture with open standard are FETC&rsquo;s strong suit as well,  which realizes non only the customer-oriented operation and service excellence,  but a robust system to reduce MLFF bad debt for concessionaires or agencies. </p>
Certainly, there is domain knowledge for scoping a  nationwide system which can be applied to other foreign countries&rsquo; contexts and  avoid them undergoing unnecessary trial and error. Up to the present, FETC acts as project delivery  partners with public sectors, investment banks, and private concessionaires in  Vietnam, Philippines, and Kazakhstan, and is in the process of partnering  collaboration in Indonesia, India, and Bosnia and Herzegovina etc.</td>

            <p>We launch our ETC service from February 10, 2006. ETC has experienced many difficulties and challenges. However, as a result of continuous efforts and team works, FETC overcame many obstacles and  steadily gained the confidence of customers and TANFB.  We are proudly steadily on the path of best ETC services.</p>

            We believe ETC project is not a traditional transportation administration or traffic flow control management system, it is an important “public service”.  Since ETC project is a business of public service, we must have the advanced prospects, strategies and operations. It is not only our objective to maintain the “First Three” but cling to the following principles: be contingent, be truthful, be innovative, and “customer first”, which all serve as the core corporate values. In addition, being innovative in internal and external aspects will increase the public confidence and expectation in ETC service.
            The way FETC running business in providing services to individual customers is to gather all information from the prospective of customers and treat customers as the first priority in any decision making. July 2007 proved to be a significant milestone for FETC because we have more than 0.1 billion drivers using ETC lanes. As we celebrate this remarkable accomplishment, however we still find rooms for further service improvement.
            <p>To gain more public confidence in ETC service, first of all we are prepared to handle any contingency and respond our customers any minute with well restructuring plans. Secondly, one of our basic requirements that we must meet and has been met is to achieve 99.98% accuracy of toll collection. Nothing but being truthful is the most important principle to meet all criteria. Lastly, “The First Three” in the world is not only an innovation but a creation. Pursuing innovation is also the strategic approach for all solution..</p>
            We value all the customer responses and reactions from various sources. And we intergrades those concerns into every action the company takes. FETC are committed to the principle of “Customer First” and make continuous progress with tremendous amount of time and efforts to achieve the highest quality of our service.

                  <p>President of  the Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC)<br>
                    <br>
                Creating the  win-win-win transportation era for society, government and the company.</p>
                <p>As a member  of the national ITS ( Intelligent  transportation system) and traffic development policies, Far Eastern Electronic  Toll Collection Co. (FETC) was officially commissioned by the Freeway Bureau, MOTC to set up the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)  service on all freeways in Taiwan. FETC is responsible for the construction and  operation of toll collection system until 2025. We are happy to dedicate our  efforts to freeway users and provide a working platform for future industrial  development in the field of transportation. Eventually, it is our goal to  create the win-win-win for the society, government and corporation.</p>
                <p>We launched the  ETC service from February 10, 2006. Since then, ETC has experienced many  difficulties and challenges. However, as a result of continuous efforts and  team works, FETC overcame many obstacles and steadily gained confidence of  customers and Freeway Bureau, MOTC. We are proud to be steadily heading toward the best ETC  services.<br>
                  <br>
&ldquo;Solution and Operation&rdquo; rendered by  FETC has 3 leading characteristics: <br>
<br>
The largest  starting operational scale in the world: ETC service was provided on all freeways  to all types of vehicles.<br>
<br>
Successful technology integration in the  world of &ldquo;IC Intelligence Card&rdquo; and OBU. <br>
<br>
The first two  systems model in the world: combing both DSRC and VPS system in the world. And,  we expect two system approach will promote the cooperation within different  industries and technological development.<br>
<br>
ETC project is not a traditional  transportation administration or traffic flow control management system, it is  an important &ldquo;public service&rdquo;. As such, we must have advanced prospects,  strategies and operations. It is not only our objective to maintain the &ldquo;Three  Number ONEs in the World&rdquo; but cling to the following principles: be contingent,  be truthful, be innovative, and &ldquo;customer first&rdquo;, which all serve as the core  corporate values. In addition, being innovative in internal and external aspects  will increase the public confidence and expectation in ETC service. The way  FETC runs business in providing services to individual customers is to gather  all information from the prospective of customers and place customers in the  first priority in any decision making. July 2007 proved to be a significant  milestone for FETC as the accumulated use of ETC lanes has reached 100 million..  As we celebrate this remarkable accomplishment, we still find rooms for further  service improvement. <br>
<br>
To gain more  public confidence in ETC service, first of all we are prepared to handle any  contingency and to respond to our customers any minute with well restructured  plans. Secondly, one of the basic requirements we must meet is to achieve  99.98% accuracy of toll collection, which we always do. Meeting all KPI requirements  is the most important principle for us. Lastly, &ldquo;Three  Number ONEs in the World&rdquo; is not only an innovation but a creation. Pursuing  innovation is also the strategic approach for all solution.<br>
<br>
We value all customer responses and  reactions from various sources. And we intergrade those concerns into every  action the company takes. FETC are committed to the principle of &ldquo;Customer First&rdquo;  and make continuous progress with tremendous amount of time and efforts to  achieve highest quality of service. It is also the target that our management  team has been trying to achieve. <br>
<br>
Well-structured  solution, excellent management team as well as the core value and vision of  FETC are all the core capability for us to success.  FETC's operation of the ETC system can  stimulate domestic development for various industries such as manufacture,  optoelectronic, information, telecommunication and financial institutions. eTag  offers the public with IT transportation convenience so that everyone is able  to enjoy a high-quality of life with advanced technology.</p>
Your concerns are always important to us because that  motivates us to achieve the best performance. We strive to reach our ultimate goals  which are to create the win-win-win situation for society, government and the  company, and we always need your continued support and ongoing interests to  fulfill the accomplishment.</td>

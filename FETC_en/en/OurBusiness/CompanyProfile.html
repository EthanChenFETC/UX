                  <p>FETC  was founded in 2004 and was entrusted by Taiwan National Freeway Bureau (TANFB)  to build and operate the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system for the  nationwide freeways. In early 2006, FETC successfully launched entry-based ETC  lanes to 23 toll stations. Later on, after eTag, which uses RFID as ETC  technology, was introduced to the public in 2012, the utilization rate  skyrocketed and has reached the threshold for TANB and FETC to introduce  distance-based and multi-lane free flow (MLFF) tolling system with 319 gantries  to the road users. The new tolling system was launched on December 30th 2013. </p>
                  <p>FETC  is dedicated to Taiwan's freeway ETC total solution, including front-end and  back-end systems as well as business model, such as planning, designing,  construction, testing, and operation. FETC has achieved great success in  implementing a multi-lane free flow, distance-based charging system since 2014.  With utilization rate of over 94%, all vehicle users in Taiwan now enjoy  driving on freeways without having to stop to pay tolls. Currently, more than 7  million vehicle users benefit from this ETC system with more than 4.8 billion  accumulated transactions in the first year. Taiwan ETC system not only advances  the intelligent transportation environment and better serves road users but  also elevates Taiwan to the new era of intelligent transportation industry.<br>
                    <br>
                    In  order to implement the advanced national transportation policies, Far Eastern  Electronic Toll Collection Co. (FETC) was commissioned by Freeway Bureau, MOTC to set up the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) service. Major  shareholders of FETC include Far Eastone Telecommunication Co., Ltd. (<a href="http://www.fetnet.net/cs/Satellite/eCorporate/ecoHome" target="_blank">FET</a>),  TECO Electric &amp; Machinery Co., Ltd. (<a href="http://www.teco.com.tw/en_version/index.asp" target="_blank">TECO</a>), <a href="http://www.systex.com.tw/english/index.asp" target="_blank">Systex Corporation</a>, and <a href="http://www.mitac.com.tw/en/index.html" target="_blank">MiTAC Inc</a>. FETC not only adopts the superior experiences from the four, but also  incorporates the excellent operational strategies from the world and adopts the  most advanced technology and at the same time embraces the following  fundamental principles: be contingent, be truthful, and be innovative. </p>
                  <p>The  per-entry-based construction of ETC was completed by 2005, and the operation  started on February 10th, 2006. With distance-based multi-lane free flow ETC  introduced on 30 December 2013, Taiwan's freeway transportation entered a new  era. The traffic time from north to south of Taiwan is found to be shortened by  average 10 minutes, with the highest reaches 40 minutes Besides, the reduction  of oil consumption and less CO2 emission are also part of the benefits of ETC..  On top of these, ETC system can offer all vehicle users value-added services as  such travel information, roadway information, mobile commerce, multimedia  entertainments, and motorcade management.</p>
                  <p>ETC  plays leading role in the development of Intelligent Transportation System  (ITS) in Taiwan and is expected to stimulate development inÂ  related domestic industries such as  manufacturing, photoelectric, information, telecommunication, and financial  industry.</p></td>

First, ETC lanes were launched in every toll station since 2006,  and then we migrated from that to a multi-lane free flow and distance-based ETC  system.</td>

The first toll station was built in Taishan on National Freeway 1 with  manual toll-collecting in July 1974.   Until 2013, there are 8 freeways in Taiwan, with a total length of  1050.6 km. There are 23 flat-rate toll stations on these freeways and the  average distance between 2 toll stations is 35 km.  And there are around 5 ~ 11 toll gates in  each direction of the toll stations.<br>
                  <br>
                  With the  advancement of technology over the years, Exact Change Toll Gate was launched  in February 1983 and the Toll Tickets Only Gate in December 1996.  In February 2006, ETC gate at toll station was  launched. </p>
                  <p>And on December 30, 2013  the old flat-rate manual/electronic hybrid toll stations were replaced by the  distance-based pay-as-you-go all electronic toll collection on all of Taiwan's  major freeways. <br>

However, there will be land  requisition and labor recruitment issues to be solved if adopting manual toll  collecting system. Therefore, distance-based system, which combines electronic  toll collection and technologies of computer and communication, serves as a  solution to the problem.</p>
  Freeway Bureau, MOTC decided to  adopt BOT model to implement the national freeway electronic toll collection  system. This system can not only expand toll collecting capacity, shorten toll  collecting time, reduce air pollution, but also be more convenient and safer  for freeway users. In short, the goal of reaching equity by &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; can  be reached by this distance-based electronic toll collecting system.</td>

Both  changes would bring impact to freeway users as they need to adjust from the  previous routine. In order to help freeway users get accustomed to the new  system, Taiwan created a two-step transition. First, transform part of flat-rate  toll gates at toll stations on major freeways to electronic toll collection to  acquaint freeway users with electronic toll collecting system. The second step  would cease all manual toll collection and adopt distance-based electronic system to reduce impact of this transition and help  freeway users accustomed to the new toll collecting system.</p>
